        <strong>74th INDEPENDENCE DAY</strong>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <p style="color: #331919;text-align: justify;">This year, on August 15, the country gears up to celebrate 74 years since India became an independent nation. At the stroke of midnight, the country broke out of the iron-grip clutches of the British colonial rule. Independence Day is celebrated with
        great pomp and show every year. The prime minister hoists the flag on Delhi's Red Fort with our national anthem playing along, giving us the feeling of patriotism and an unlimited amount of goosebumps on our arms. Apart from that, the day is filled
        with listening to patriotic songs, eating sweets, and fist-thumping declarations of love for the nation. However, this year, the celebrations will be quite muted. With the ongoing pandemic, everyone has been asked to witness the festivities from
        the comfort of their homes. Even the obligatory flag-hoisting ceremony at the Red Fort will see only 5000 people in the audience, with the compliance of social distancing at all times.
